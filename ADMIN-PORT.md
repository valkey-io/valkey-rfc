# ADMIN PORT RFC

## Abstract

In Valkey.conf, Add a new config parameter: "admin-port" to allow internal administrators in a company or special users from public internet to connect to the Valkey server to execute some special commands or load specfic modules.


## Motivation

For adminstrators, they may want to execute some special commands in the server, and other general clients are not allowed to run these kinds of commands.
We want to let adminstrator connect to this admin port to do some special things. 

Beside above mentioned, we could implement the following features in the future:
1. The connections through admin port are not limited to maxclient number, we can always guarantee they can connect to the server.
2. Some status check commands could be sent and receied through admin port, we can do some special logic to make sure they have opportunity to be handle first, such as:
   PING, HELLO, ECHO, INFO etc


## Design Considerations

Before we propose the "admin-port" feature, we have the following 3 candidates:
1. ACL: Now Valkey have ACL feature to implement similar function, but it brings one disadvantages: username need to be predefined.

2. Run some special commands through the connected IP address: Before we run every commands, we need check if the client ip address is in a linkedlist, it costs
                                                               CPU and extra memory, it causes side effect in performance

3. Iptables: It works on transport layer and IP address, but it can not apply to the specific commands of the Valkey

Based on all above 3 candidate defects, we decide to select "admin-port" to implement our goal.
