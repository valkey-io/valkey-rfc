# ADMIN PORT RFC

## Abstract

In Valkey.conf, Add a new config parameter: "admin-port" to allow cloud providers or internal administrators in a company or special users from public internet to connect to the Valkey server to execute some special commands or load specfic modules.

## Motivation

For adminstrators, they may want to execute some special commands for system administration in the server, such as authentication or traffic control commands, which are usually defined in the module. And other general clients are not allowed to run these kinds of commands. Thus connecting to an admin-port is a good way to implement this feature. 

Beside above mentioned, we could implement the following enhancement features in the future once admin-port is commited:
1. The connections through admin port are not limited to maxclient number, we can always guarantee the administrators can connect to the server.
2. Some status check commands or dangerous commands could be sent and received through admin port, we can do some special logic to make sure they have opportunity to be handle first, such as: PING, HELLO, ECHO, INFO, FLUSHALL etc

## Design Considerations

Before we propose the "admin-port" feature, we have the following 3 candidates:
1. ACL: Now Valkey have ACL feature to implement similar function, but it brings two disadvantages: firstly, username need to be predefined and secondly, total number of client connections can not exceed the maxclient. Once the emergence issue happens and maxclient number reaches, the privilege user can not connect to the server any more.

2. Run some special customize commands for system administration through the connected IP address: Before we run every commands, we need check if the client ip address is in a linkedlist, it costs CPU and extra memory, it causes side effect in performance

3. Iptables: It works on transport layer and IP address, but it can not apply to the specific commands of the Valkey

Based on all above 3 candidate defects, we decide to select "admin-port" to implement our goal.


## Specification

1. The admin client role is only decided by the cloud providers or internal administrators, whatever where the client comes from. Thus generally, admin-port should not be exposed to the public.
2. For every module, there is the API RedisModule_CreateCommand which defines a function to execute your customize command. You can find a way to to get the port number that client connects to the server and then to decide if the command can be called by the client.
3. For those Valkey built-in commands, generally we do not consider Valkey built-in commands as the special commands. Of course, now we can consider FLUSHALL command as an exception.
4. If a client connects via admin-port and ACL rules apply to this client as well, this client should follow the ACL to execute some commands
5. If a client connects via non-admin-port and ACL rules apply to this client as well, this client is not allowed to execute those special commands. The special commands could be new commands introduced by admin through modules, for example, setting/getting traffic/replication control threshold, encrypting the username and password in config file, etc
